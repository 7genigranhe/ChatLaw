If you want to remove unwanted programs from your Windows PC, you might be tempted to use the built-in Add or Remove Programs tool. However, this tool often leaves behind traces of the uninstalled programs, such as registry entries, files, and folders. These leftovers can clutter your system and slow down your performance.

That's why you need a powerful software uninstaller like **Advanced Uninstaller Pro 11**. This tool can help you uninstall programs quickly and thoroughly, without leaving any traces behind. It also has other features that can help you optimize your PC, such as a startup manager, a registry cleaner, a file shredder, and more.
 
One of the most useful features of Advanced Uninstaller Pro 11 is the **Daily Health Check**. This feature scans your PC every day for junk files, browser traces, broken shortcuts, and other issues that can affect your performance and privacy. It then gives you a report and lets you fix all the problems with one click.
 
However, the Daily Health Check feature is not free. You need to activate it with a serial number that you can purchase from the official website. A 30-day license costs $9.10, a one-year license costs $10.15, and a two-year license costs $15.60. If you don't want to pay for this feature, you can still use all the other features of Advanced Uninstaller Pro 11 for free.
 
So how do you use Advanced Uninstaller Pro 11 to uninstall programs completely? Here are the steps:
 
1. Download and install Advanced Uninstaller Pro 11 from [here](https://www.advanceduninstaller.com/download.html).
2. Launch the program and click on the "Uninstall Programs" tool.

5. After the uninstallation is done, click on the "Clean" button to scan for any leftovers.
6. Select the leftovers that you want to delete and click on the "Delete" button.
7. Repeat these steps for any other programs that you want to uninstall.

That's it! You have successfully uninstalled programs completely with Advanced Uninstaller Pro 11. You can also use the other tools in the program to optimize your PC and protect your privacy.
