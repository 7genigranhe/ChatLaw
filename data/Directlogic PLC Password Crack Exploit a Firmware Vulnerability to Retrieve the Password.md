DirectLogic PLCs are programmable logic controllers (PLCs) manufactured by AutomationDirect. They are used to control industrial processes and machines. Sometimes, engineers or operators may need to access or modify the PLC settings or programs, but they may not know the password that protects them. This can happen if the password is forgotten, lost, or set by someone who has left the company.

In such cases, some people may resort to searching the web for a solution. They may find websites or social media accounts that advertise tools that claim to crack passwords for DirectLogic PLCs and other industrial products. However, these tools are not only illegal and unethical, but also dangerous. They can exploit a vulnerability in the PLC firmware and deliver malware to the host computer.
 
According to Dragos, a cybersecurity company that specializes in industrial systems, such tools have been found to exploit a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2022-2003) that allows them to retrieve the PLC password in clear text by sending a specially crafted request over Ethernet or serial port[^1^] [^2^]. AutomationDirect has patched this vulnerability in firmware version 2.72, which was released in June 2022[^3^].
 
However, the password cracking tools also drop a malware called Sality on the host computer. Sality is a well-known malware that has been around for two decades. It is used by cybercriminals for various purposes, such as cryptocurrency theft, password cracking, botnet creation, and antivirus evasion[^1^] [^2^]. Sality can block any outgoing connections from the host computer, preventing antivirus updates and violating reliability standards[^1^]. It can also steal cryptocurrency during transactions by replacing the original wallet address with the attacker's wallet address[^2^].
 
Dragos warns that such password cracking tools are not limited to DirectLogic PLCs. They also claim to support several other PLCs, human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and project files from various vendors, such as Omron, Siemens, ABB, Delta Automation, Fuji Electric, Mitsubishi Electric, Schneider Electric, Vigor PLC, Weintek, Rockwell Automation, Panasonic, Fatek, IDEC Corporation, and LG[^1^] [^2^]. It is likely that these tools also exploit vulnerabilities and deliver malware.

Therefore, it is strongly advised that industrial engineers and operators do not use such password cracking tools for PLCs and HMIs. They should instead contact the vendor or a trusted partner for assistance. They should also keep their PLC firmware and antivirus software updated and follow best practices for industrial cybersecurity.
  
How to Crack Passwords for DirectLogic PLCs and Why You Shouldn't (continued)
 
Using password cracking tools for PLCs and HMIs is not only risky, but also unnecessary. There are legitimate and safe ways to recover or reset passwords for industrial products. For example, AutomationDirect provides a password recovery service for its DirectLogic PLCs. Customers can contact the technical support team and provide the serial number of the PLC. The team will then generate a temporary password that can be used to access the PLC and change the password.
 
Other vendors may have similar services or procedures for password recovery or reset. Alternatively, customers can contact authorized distributors or partners who can provide assistance or guidance. In some cases, it may be possible to reset the password by using a hardware switch or jumper on the PLC or HMI device. However, this should be done with caution and only after consulting the vendor or the user manual.
 
Password cracking tools for PLCs and HMIs are not worth the risk. They can compromise the security and reliability of industrial systems and expose them to malicious attacks. They can also violate laws and regulations that protect intellectual property and trade secrets. Therefore, industrial engineers and operators should avoid using such tools and seek legitimate and safe solutions instead.
