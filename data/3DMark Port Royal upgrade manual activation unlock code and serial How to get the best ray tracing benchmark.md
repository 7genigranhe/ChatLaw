If you have bought the upgrade from the UL Benchmarks website, you will need to manually activate it on Steam using a license key. The process varies depending on the type of key you have. Here are the steps for each type of key:
 
- For a license that starts with 3DM-ICFTP-, first create an account on 3dmark.com or log in to your existing account. If your 3dmark.com account does not have a Steam sign-in associated with it, you need to add the Steam sign-in method to your account before you can add your license key. Next, go to the Settings page, add your license key in the box under ADD 3DMARK UPGRADE WITH PORT ROYAL TO YOUR STEAM LIBRARY, and then click on the SUBMIT button. This action can be performed only once for a license key[^1^].
- For an upgrade license that starts with 3DM-PR-, first create an account on 3dmark.com or log in to your existing account. If your 3dmark.com account does not have a Steam sign-in associated with it, you need to add the Steam sign-in method to your account before you can add your license key. Next, go to the Settings page, add your license key in the box under ADD 3DMARK PORT ROYAL UPGRADE TO YOUR STEAM LIBRARY, and then click on the SUBMIT button. Please note that you must already own 3DMark Advanced Edition in your Steam account for this option to be available. This action can be performed only once for a license key[^1^].
- For licenses that start with 3DM-ICFTPS-, 3DM-SPD-, or 3DM-STO-, due to a Steam policy change, these standalone 3DMark Advanced licenses cannot be added to your Steam account. You can still use any 3DMark Steam license on the standalone version of 3DMark. You can see your 3DMark standalone licenses in the Steam version by going to "Options"[^1^].
- For a license that starts with 3DM-ICF-, open the Steam client, click the "+ADD A GAME" button at the bottom of the window, then "ACTIVATE A PRODUCT ON STEAM," and then follow the instructions[^1^].

If you have bought the upgrade from Steam, you do not need to activate it manually. It will be automatically added to your Steam library after purchase.
