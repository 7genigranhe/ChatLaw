Fundamentals of Molecular Spectroscopy is a book that provides an elementary and non-mathematical introduction to molecular spectroscopy. The book covers various topics such as electromagnetic radiation, microwave spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, electronic spectroscopy of atoms and molecules, spin resonance spectroscopy, and Mossbauer spectroscopy. The book also explains the basic principles, techniques, and applications of each spectroscopic method.
 
The book is written by C.N. Banwell, a former professor of chemistry at the University of Sussex, and Elaine M. McCash, a senior lecturer in chemistry at the University of York. The book was first published in 1962 and has been revised and updated several times. The latest edition is the fifth edition, which was published in 2013 by Tata McGraw Hill Education. The book is suitable for undergraduate students and beginners who want to learn the fundamentals of molecular spectroscopy.

## Applications of Molecular Spectroscopy
 
Molecular spectroscopy has a wide range of applications in various fields of science and technology. Some of the main applications are:
 
- Spectroscopy is used to determine the structure of atoms and molecules. It can reveal the electronic configuration of atoms in the ground state and excited state, as well as the vibrational and rotational modes of molecules. Spectroscopy can also provide information about the bonding, symmetry, and geometry of molecules.
- Spectroscopy is used as an analytical method for finding the constituents and composition of materials having unknown chemical composition. Spectroscopy can detect trace elements in a sample with high sensitivity and specificity. Spectroscopy can also be used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of mixtures, solutions, and gases.
- Spectroscopy is used to study the physical and chemical properties of materials. It can measure various parameters such as temperature, pressure, density, viscosity, refractive index, electric and magnetic fields, etc. Spectroscopy can also monitor the changes in these parameters due to external stimuli or internal processes.
- Spectroscopy is used to investigate the dynamics and interactions of atoms and molecules. It can observe the energy transfer, relaxation, and decay processes that occur in excited states. It can also study the collisional and radiative processes that affect the spectral line shapes and intensities. Spectroscopy can also probe the chemical reactions by following the formation and dissociation of molecular species.
- Spectroscopy is used as a tool for exploring various phenomena in nature and in laboratory. It can be applied to study the structure and evolution of stars, planets, galaxies, and other celestial objects. It can also be used to study the properties and behavior of plasmas, lasers, solids, liquids, gases, biomolecules, nanomaterials, etc.

These are some of the examples of the applications of molecular spectroscopy. However, there are many more applications that are beyond the scope of this article.
