## The Drum Machines and the Studio Channels
  
Electro-Acoustic features 15 classic drum machines from various eras and genres, such as Roland TR-808, LinnDrum, Oberheim DMX, Simmons SDS-V, Korg Mini Pops, and more. Each drum machine has its own distinctive sound and character, and you can scroll through them for each kit piece using the Drum Kit panel.
  
But what makes Electro-Acoustic really stand out is the way these drum machines were recorded. Soniccouture took a club PA system to two different studios and blasted the drum sounds through high-end mics, vintage consoles, valve pre-amps, bass-amps, acoustic drum shells, and even PA speakers. The result is a collection of 11 studio channels for each drum sound, each with its own tone and texture.

You can mix and match these channels to create any drum sound you desire, from clean and crisp to dirty and distorted. You can also shape each channel with pitch, envelope, filter, EQ, compressor, saturation, reverb, width, and master effects. The possibilities are endless!
  
## The Kontakt Instrument Interface and How to Customize Your Kits
  
Electro-Acoustic comes with a user-friendly Kontakt instrument interface that lets you customize your kits with ease. The main screen is divided into three sections: the Drum Kit panel, the Mixer panel, and the Options panel.
  
The Drum Kit panel is where you select your drums by kit piece (kick, snare, hi-hat, etc.), scroll through different drum machines for each piece, adjust the volume and pan of each channel, and edit the pitch, envelope, and filter settings for each sound. You can also access the advanced mode to edit these parameters for each channel independently.
  
The Mixer panel is where you fine-tune your sound with EQ, compressor, saturation, reverb, width, and master effects for each drum channel. You can also send each channel to a separate Kontakt output in your DAW for additional mixing. The reverb processor is custom-made for Electro-Acoustic and features four different algorithms: Plate, Room 1 (SOTA studio), Room 2 (MV studio), and PA.
  
The Options panel is where you manage the polyphony of Electro-Acoustic (since each drum has 11 channels), set up your user key mapping (to trigger different drums from your MIDI keyboard), and access the manual.
  
## The Creative Sequencers and How to Generate Grooves
  
Electro-Acoustic also comes with three creative sequencers that let you generate grooves in different ways: Euclidean Beats, Beat Shifter, and Poly Beats.
  
Euclidean Beats is a revolutionary way of creating drum patterns based on mathematical principles. You can set any number of hits and any number of steps per track (up to six tracks), and Euclid will space them out equally for you. You can also adjust the rotation and offset of each track to create variations. You can drag and drop MIDI patterns from Euclidean Beats to your DAW or save them as presets.
  
Beat Shifter is a six-track step sequencer that allows you to program your beats with generative 'beat shifting' functions. Each
