## What is INVERSUS Deluxe?
 
INVERSUS Deluxe is an enhanced version of the original INVERSUS game that was released in 2016. The game is developed by Hypersect, an independent studio led by Ryan Juckett, a former programmer at Bungie. The game is inspired by classic arcade games such as Pac-Man, Asteroids, and Geometry Wars. The game has a minimalist aesthetic that uses only two colors: black and white. The game's core mechanic is that you can only move on the opposite color of your tile, and you can flip the color of the tiles by shooting them. This creates a dynamic and strategic gameplay that requires you to constantly adapt to the changing environment and your enemies' movements.
