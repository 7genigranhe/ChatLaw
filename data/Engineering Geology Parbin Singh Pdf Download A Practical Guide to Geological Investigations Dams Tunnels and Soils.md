The book is well-written, comprehensive and informative. It can serve as a reference book for academic and professional purposes.
  
Engineering geology is a branch of geology that applies the principles and methods of geology to engineering problems. Engineering geology is concerned with the investigation, characterization and evaluation of the geological conditions that affect the design, construction and operation of engineering structures and projects. Engineering geology also provides solutions and recommendations to mitigate the geological hazards and risks that may arise during the engineering activities.
 
Some of the engineering structures and projects that require engineering geology are dams, reservoirs, tunnels, bridges, highways, railways, pipelines, buildings, foundations, slopes, landslides, earthquakes, coastal erosion, groundwater management and more. Engineering geology involves the use of various tools and techniques such as field mapping, drilling, sampling, testing, logging, geophysical surveys, remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), numerical modeling and more. Engineering geology also requires the knowledge and skills of other disciplines such as civil engineering, mining engineering, metallurgy engineering, hydrology, seismology, soil mechanics, rock mechanics and more.
