# A Review of Computer Security: Art and Science by Matt Bishop
 
Computer security is a complex and challenging field that requires a solid foundation of theory and practice. In this book, Matt Bishop, a professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California at Davis, provides a comprehensive and rigorous introduction to the principles and techniques of computer security. The book covers a wide range of topics, from basic concepts such as threats, policies, cryptography, and assurance, to advanced topics such as vulnerability analysis, intrusion detection, and attack analysis. The book also includes numerous examples, exercises, case studies, and references to help readers apply the concepts and methods to real-world scenarios.

The book is divided into four parts: Introduction, Policy, Cryptography, and Assurance. The first part introduces the goals, problems, and challenges of computer security, as well as the relationship between policy and security, the role of cryptography, and the importance of assurance. The second part discusses different policy models for confidentiality, integrity, availability, and other security properties, and how they can be used to constrain operations and enforce security. The third part explains the basics of cryptography, such as symmetric and asymmetric encryption, digital signatures, hash functions, and public-key infrastructures. The fourth part presents various techniques for achieving assurance, such as formal methods, system design principles, program analysis tools, auditing methods, and intrusion detection systems.
 
The book is suitable for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in computer science and related fields, as well as for IT professionals who want to learn more about computer security. The book assumes some background in discrete mathematics, programming languages, operating systems, and networks. The book is also a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners who need to keep up with the latest developments and challenges in computer security.
 
Computer Security: Art and Science is a comprehensive guide that links core principles with technologies, methodologies, and ideas that have emerged since the first edition was published in 2002. The book reflects the dramatic growth in the quantity, complexity, and consequences of security incidents, and offers clear, rigorous, and thorough coverage of modern computer security.
  
The book is organized in a logical and coherent way, with each chapter building on the previous ones. The book also provides a roadmap that shows how the chapters are related and how they can be used for different purposes. The book is well-written and easy to follow, with clear definitions, explanations, examples, and diagrams. The book also includes many exercises and problems that test the reader's understanding and challenge them to apply the concepts and methods to new situations. The book also provides solutions and hints for some of the exercises and problems.
 
The book is not only a textbook, but also a detailed reference that contains valuable information for even the most seasoned computer security professional. The book covers both the theoretical and practical aspects of computer security, and provides a balanced perspective that considers both the attacker's and the defender's point of view. The book also discusses the ethical and legal issues that arise in computer security, such as privacy, intellectual property, and liability. The book also includes appendices that provide additional material on topics such as number theory, formal languages, logic, and proofs.
