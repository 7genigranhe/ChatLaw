# Minority Hearts6: A New Card Game for Diversity and Inclusion
 
Minority Hearts6 is a new card game that aims to promote diversity and inclusion among players. The game is based on the classic card game Hearts, but with a twist: each suit represents a different minority group, such as race, gender, sexuality, or disability. The goal of the game is to avoid taking tricks that contain cards from your own minority group, while trying to make your opponents take them. The game challenges players to empathize with other minority groups and to learn about their struggles and achievements.
 
The game was created by a team of students from the University of California, Berkeley, who wanted to raise awareness and foster dialogue about diversity and inclusion on campus and beyond. They launched a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter to fund the production and distribution of the game. The campaign has already surpassed its initial goal of $10,000 and has received positive feedback from backers and supporters.

"We wanted to create a game that was fun and engaging, but also educational and meaningful," said Jessica Lee, one of the creators of Minority Hearts6. "We hope that by playing this game, people can have more open and respectful conversations about diversity and inclusion, and also celebrate the richness and diversity of our society."
 
Minority Hearts6 is suitable for 3 to 6 players, ages 12 and up. The game consists of 54 cards, each featuring a unique illustration and a fact or trivia about a minority group. The game also comes with a rulebook and a guidebook that provide more information and resources about diversity and inclusion. The game is expected to be delivered to backers by December 2023.
  
The creators of Minority Hearts6 said that they were inspired by their own experiences as members of minority groups and by the social movements that have been advocating for diversity and inclusion in recent years. They said that they wanted to create a game that could spark meaningful conversations and connections among people from different backgrounds and perspectives.
 
"We believe that games can be powerful tools for social change and education," said Kevin Chen, another creator of Minority Hearts6. "Games can create immersive and interactive experiences that can challenge our assumptions and biases, and also inspire us to take action and make a difference."
 
The creators of Minority Hearts6 also said that they hope that their game can inspire other game designers and developers to create more games that address diversity and inclusion issues. They said that they are open to collaborating with other organizations and individuals who share their vision and mission.
 
"We want to see more games that celebrate diversity and inclusion, and that can reach a wider audience and have a positive impact on society," said Maria Gonzalez, another creator of Minority Hearts6. "We think that games can be a great way to spread awareness and empathy, and to create a more inclusive and respectful culture."
