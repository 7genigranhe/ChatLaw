## New Dark Theme
 
One of the most noticeable changes in Burp Suite Professional 2.0.11 Beta is the new dark theme, which gives Burp a sleek and modern look. The dark theme is designed to reduce eye strain and improve readability in low-light environments. It also helps to highlight important information and contrast different elements of the user interface. The dark theme can be enabled or disabled from the user options menu.
 
## New Crawler
 
Burp Suite Professional 2.0.11 Beta features a new crawler that is able to automatically handle sessions, detect changes in application state, crawl with multiple logins, and deal with volatile content[^2^]. The new crawler is more intelligent and efficient than the old spider, as it can identify and follow links that are dynamically generated by JavaScript, handle complex authentication mechanisms, avoid crawling duplicate or irrelevant pages, and cope with application errors. The new crawler also generates a navigational graph that shows how different pages are connected and what parameters are used to access them.
 
## New Scanning Engine
 
Burp Suite Professional 2.0.11 Beta also introduces a new scanning engine that features automatic session handling, multiple scan phases, improved detection of stored input, consolidation of site-wide passive issues, efficient treatment of frequently occurring insertion points, and graceful handling of application errors[^2^]. The new scanning engine is more accurate and comprehensive than the old one, as it can perform various types of tests depending on the context and nature of each request and response, detect vulnerabilities that are reflected or stored in different parts of the application, group similar issues together to avoid cluttering the results, prioritize important insertion points over less relevant ones, and recover from unexpected situations without crashing or hanging.

Users can also pause, resume, cancel, or modify tasks from the dashboard.
 
## New REST API

## Conclusion
 
Burp Suite Professional 2.0.11 Beta is a major upgrade that brings a host of new features and improvements to the web security testing tool. The new dark theme, crawler, scanner, dashboard, and REST API enhance Burp's usability, performance, accuracy, and extensibility. However, users should be aware that this is still a beta release and may contain bugs or limitations that could affect their testing results or experience. Users who prefer a stable and mature product may want to stick with Burp Suite Professional 1.\* until Burp Suite Professional 2.\* is officially out of beta.
