## What is CDA?
 
CDA is a software that allows users to diagnose and program Chrysler Group cars. It works with the following original interfaces: wiTECH VCI Pod, StarSCAN, StarMOBILE. It also possibly works with third-party interfaces from Vector Hardware: CANcardX, CANcardXL, CANcaseXL, CANcardXLe, CANboardXL[^1^] [^2^].
 
CDA is deployed without any ECU or vehicle data. ECU and other data required by certain features of the application are available via the Diagnostic Workbench. These pieces of data must be installed into the CDA by the user. Also, the user is responsible for updating existing data on a StarSCAN or PC and deleting data no longer needed on a StarSCAN or PC. The File Management features of the application assist users with these tasks[^2^].
