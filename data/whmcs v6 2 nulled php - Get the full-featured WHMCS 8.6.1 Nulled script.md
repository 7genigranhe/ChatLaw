WHMCS is a popular billing and automation software for web hosting providers. It allows you to manage your clients, invoices, orders, domains, tickets, and more. However, WHMCS is not free and requires a license to use.
 
Some people may want to use WHMCS without paying for a license. They may look for a nulled version of WHMCS, which is a cracked or modified version that bypasses the license check. However, using a nulled version of WHMCS is illegal, unethical, and risky. You may face legal issues, security breaches, malware infections, data loss, and poor performance.
