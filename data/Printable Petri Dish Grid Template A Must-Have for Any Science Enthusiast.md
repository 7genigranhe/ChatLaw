# How to Make Your Own Printable Petri Dish Grid Template
 
A petri dish grid template is a useful tool for counting colonies of bacteria or other microorganisms grown on agar plates. It helps you to divide the surface of the petri dish into equal sections and estimate the number of colonies in each section. You can then multiply the average number of colonies by the total number of sections to get the total number of colonies on the plate.
 
While you can buy pre-made petri dish grid templates from scientific suppliers, they can be expensive and may not fit your specific petri dish size. Alternatively, you can make your own printable petri dish grid template using a simple online tool and some paper and scissors. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Go to [https://www.printablepaper.net/category/graph](https://www.printablepaper.net/category/graph) and choose a square graph paper template that matches your petri dish size. For example, if your petri dish has a diameter of 90 mm, you can choose the 5 mm square graph paper.
2. Download the template as a PDF file and open it with a PDF reader.
3. Print the template on a sheet of paper. Make sure to print it at actual size and not fit to page.
4. Cut out a circle from the paper that matches the diameter of your petri dish. You can use a compass or a circular object as a guide.
5. Place the paper circle on top of your petri dish and align the center of the circle with the center of the dish. You can use some tape to secure it in place.
6. Use a pen or a marker to mark the sections on the paper circle that correspond to the grid lines on the graph paper. You can also label each section with a number or a letter for easy identification.
7. Remove the paper circle from the petri dish and laminate it with clear tape or plastic wrap. This will protect it from moisture and contamination.
8. Your printable petri dish grid template is ready to use. You can place it on top of your petri dish whenever you need to count colonies. Make sure to sanitize it before and after each use.

Why use a petri dish grid template?
 
A petri dish grid template can help you to obtain more accurate and consistent results when counting colonies. It can also save you time and effort by reducing the need to count each colony individually. By using a petri dish grid template, you can avoid errors such as overcounting, undercounting, or missing colonies that are too small or too close together.

How to use a petri dish grid template?
 
To use a petri dish grid template, you need to follow these steps:

- Place your petri dish on a flat surface and turn on a light source above it.
- Place your printable petri dish grid template on top of your petri dish and align the center of the template with the center of the dish.
- Count the number of colonies in each section of the template. You can use a magnifying glass or a microscope if needed.
- Record the number of colonies in each section on a data sheet or a spreadsheet.
- Calculate the average number of colonies per section by adding up the numbers and dividing by the total number of sections.
- Multiply the average number of colonies per section by the total number of sections to get the total number of colonies on the plate.
- Report your results with the appropriate units and error margins.
