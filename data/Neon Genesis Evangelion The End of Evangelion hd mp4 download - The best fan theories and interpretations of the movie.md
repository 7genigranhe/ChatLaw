Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of the most influential and acclaimed anime series of all time, but its ending has been a source of controversy and confusion for decades. The original TV series ended with two abstract and psychological episodes that left many fans unsatisfied and puzzled. To provide a more conclusive and cinematic finale, the creators released a feature-length film in 1997 called Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End of Evangelion, which depicts the events of the final two episodes in a different way.
 
The End of Evangelion is widely regarded as a masterpiece of animation and storytelling, but it is also notoriously hard to find online. The film has been out of print for years in most regions, and it is not available on any streaming service. However, there are still some ways to watch it legally and in high quality.

One option is to buy or rent the film on Amazon Prime Video, where it is available in HD for $3.99 (rent) or $14.99 (buy). This is the only official digital release of the film, and it includes both the original Japanese audio with subtitles and the English dub. However, this option is only available in the US and Canada.
 
Another option is to buy the DVD or Blu-ray of the film, which can be found on various online retailers such as eBay or Amazon. However, these are also very rare and expensive, as they are out of print and often imported from other countries. The DVD version has poor video quality and only includes the English dub, while the Blu-ray version has better video quality and both audio options. However, both versions have different subtitles from the Prime Video release, which some fans prefer or dislike.
 
A third option is to wait for the upcoming release of Neon Genesis Evangelion: Ultimate Edition, a Blu-ray box set that will include the entire TV series and all the films, including The End of Evangelion. This box set will be released by GKIDS in December 2021, and it will cost $274.99. It will feature remastered video and audio, new subtitles and dub scripts, and a wealth of bonus features and extras. However, this option is also limited to North America, and it will likely sell out quickly due to high demand.
 
Whichever option you choose, you will need a compatible device to play the film, such as a computer, a TV, a Blu-ray player, or a streaming device. You will also need a stable internet connection if you opt for the Prime Video or GKIDS release. Finally, you will need to be prepared for an intense and emotional experience that will challenge your expectations and leave you speechless.
  
If you are wondering what happens in The End of Evangelion, here is a brief plot summary. The film is divided into two parts: Episode 25': Air and Episode 26': My Purest Heart for You. The first part follows the invasion of NERV headquarters by the JSSDF, a military force sent by SEELE, a secret organization that wants to initiate the Human Instrumentality Project, a plan to merge all humans into a single entity. Asuka, one of the pilots of the giant robots called Evangelions, wakes up from a coma and fights against nine mass-produced Evangelions sent by SEELE. Meanwhile, Shinji, the main protagonist and another pilot, is depressed and traumatized by the death of Kaworu, an Angel who was also his love interest. He is rescued by Misato, his guardian and NERV's operations director, who tries to motivate him to pilot his Evangelion and stop SEELE's plan. However, Shinji refuses and runs away. Misato is killed by JSSDF soldiers while trying to protect him.
 
The second part follows Shinji's confrontation with Rei, another pilot who is also a clone of his mother and Lilith, the progenitor of humanity. Rei rejects Gendo, Shinji's father and NERV's commander, who wanted to use her to initiate his own version of Instrumentality and reunite with his dead wife. Rei instead merges with Lilith and gives Shinji the choice to decide the fate of humanity. Shinji initially chooses Instrumentality, as he is overwhelmed by his loneliness and despair. He enters a surreal world where he interacts with various characters and explores his own psyche. He realizes that he hates himself and that he is afraid of human relationships because of the pain they can cause. However, he also learns that he can change himself and that he can find happiness in others. He decides to reject Instrumentality and restore individuality to humanity. He wakes up on a beach next to Asuka, who survived her battle. The film ends with Shinji strangling Asuka, who caresses his face. She says "How disgusting" before the credits roll.
